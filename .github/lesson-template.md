## üìù Course Companion: Modern Classroom Curriculum Implementation

> **This curriculum and lesson template are designed using the Modern Classrooms Project (MCP) model, emphasizing mastery-based, self-paced, and blended instruction.**

---

### üìò Curriculum Design Overview

#### 1. **Mastery-Based Learning**
- Students progress after demonstrating mastery (via mastery checks, feedback, revision, and reassessment).
- **Competency over speed** is prioritized.

#### 2. **Self-Pacing**
- Students move at their own pace using progress tracking, lesson classification (must-do, should-do, aspire-to-do), motivation, and reflection.

#### 3. **Blended Instruction**
- Mix of online (videos, digital activities) and in-person learning (small group, one-on-one, whole-class as needed).

#### 4. **Learning Design**
- Clear structure and routines; content is organized in a Learning Management System (LMS) with classroom tours and procedures.

#### 5. **Launch and Implementation**
- Includes strategies for rollout, lesson walkthroughs, and overcoming challenges.
