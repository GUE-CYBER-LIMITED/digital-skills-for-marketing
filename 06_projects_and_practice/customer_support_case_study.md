Welcome to Lesson 21 of our course! Today, you'll analyze a **Customer Support Case Study**, applying skills from Module 3 (customer service, CRM) and Module 5 (communication, time management). This beginner-friendly lesson uses simple language, fun analogies, and hands-on activities for your **Windows computer** or **Android phone**. We'll cover what a case study is, how to analyze one, and how to propose solutions. By the end, you'll solve a mock customer issue like a support pro. Let's dive in!

## What is a Customer Support Case Study?

A **Customer Support Case Study** is like a **detective story**, where you investigate a customer's problem, analyze what went wrong, and suggest fixes using support tools and skills. It's a real or pretend scenario that teaches you how to handle queries effectively.

Think of a case study as solving a puzzle:
- The **customer's issue** is the puzzle's missing piece.
- **Support tools** (e.g., Zendesk, Module 3) and **skills** (Module 5) are your clues.
- The **solution** is fitting the piece to complete the picture.

This project uses Module 3's CRM knowledge and Module 5's communication to resolve issues.

### Why is a Customer Support Case Study Important?
A case study matters because it:
- **Teaches Problem-Solving**: Shows how to handle real customer issues.
- **Improves Service Skills**: Practices empathy and clarity (Module 5).
- **Enhances CRM Use**: Applies tools like Zendesk (Module 3).
- **Prepares for Jobs**: Employers value support experience.

## Key Concepts of a Customer Support Case Study

Let's explore the main components with examples for your Windows computer or Android phone.

### 1. Case Description
**What it is**: The details of the customer's problem, including their query type (Module 3: informational, complaint) and context.

**Example**: On your Windows computer, you might read in Google Docs, "Customer: Sarah, Issue: Wrong item delivered." On your Android phone, you'd view the same case in the Docs app.

**Illustration**: The case is like a crime scene. You note the evidence (issue details) to start investigating.

### 2. Analysis
**What it is**: Examining the issue to understand what went wrong, using CRM data or communication clues.

**Example**: On your Android phone, you might note in a note-taking app, "Wrong item sent due to inventory error, Sarah is upset." On your Windows computer, you'd analyze using Zendesk's ticket history (Module 3).

**Illustration**: Analysis is like a doctor's diagnosis. You check symptoms (issue) to find the cause (error).

### 3. Solution and Follow-Up
**What it is**: Proposing a fix (e.g., refund, replacement) and checking customer satisfaction, using Module 5's communication skills.

**Example**: On your Windows computer, you might write, "Send correct item, apologize, follow up in 3 days." On your Android phone, you'd draft a similar solution in Gmail.

**Illustration**: The solution is like fixing a broken toy. You repair it (resolve issue) and check it works (follow-up).

## How to Analyze a Customer Support Case Study

Here's how to tackle a case study:

1. **Read the Case**: Understand the customer's issue and context.  
   - Example: "Customer: John, Issue: Overcharged for order."

2. **Analyze the Problem**: Identify the cause using CRM or communication clues.  
   - Example: "Billing error in system, John emailed angrily."

3. **Propose a Solution**: Suggest a fix with clear, empathetic communication (Module 5).  
   - Example: "Refund John, send apology email."

4. **Plan Follow-Up**: Describe how to ensure satisfaction (Module 3).  
   - Example: "Email John in 2 days to confirm refund."

5. **Document**: Write your analysis and solution in a clear format (Module 4, Google Docs).  
   - Example: Save the case study in Google Drive.

**Illustration**: A case study is like a recipe:  
- **Read**: Check ingredients (case details).  
- **Analyze**: Find the right mix (cause).  
- **Solution**: Cook the dish (fix).  
- **Follow-Up**: Taste it (check satisfaction).  
- **Document**: Write the recipe (report).
