## What are a Resume and Portfolio?

A **Resume** is like a **snapshot of your skills**, summarizing your education, experience, and abilities to impress employers. A **Portfolio** is a collection of your work (e.g., projects, designs) that shows what you can do, like a digital scrapbook.

Think of a resume and portfolio as a job interview outfit:
- The **resume** is your polished suit, giving a quick, professional overview.
- The **portfolio** is your accessories, showing your unique style (work samples).
- Together, they make you stand out in a crowd (job market).

This project uses Module 4’s Google Docs for resumes and Module 5’s communication for clarity.

### Why are a Resume and Portfolio Important?
Resumes and portfolios matter because they:
- **Get You Noticed**: Employers spend 6–8 seconds scanning resumes.
- **Showcase Skills**: Highlight abilities from Modules 1–6 (e.g., marketing, support).
- **Prove Experience**: Portfolios demonstrate real work, like campaign plans (Lesson 1).
- **Boost Confidence**: A strong resume makes you feel ready for opportunities.

## Key Concepts of a Resume and Portfolio

Let’s explore the main components with examples for your Windows computer or Android phone.

### 1. Resume Structure
**What it is**: A resume has sections like contact info, summary, skills, experience, and education, written clearly (Module 5).

**Example**: On your Windows computer, you might write in Google Docs, “Skills: Digital Marketing, Excel, Customer Support.” On your Android phone, you’d edit the same resume in the Docs app.

**Sections**:
- **Contact Info**: Name, email, phone.
- **Summary**: 2–3 sentences about you.
- **Skills**: List relevant abilities (e.g., SEO, Module 2).
- **Experience**: Jobs or projects (e.g., campaign plan, Lesson 1).
- **Education**: Degrees or courses.

**Illustration**: A resume is like a menu. It lists dishes (skills, experience) to entice the diner (employer).

### 2. Portfolio Content
**What it is**: A collection of work samples, like documents, screenshots, or links, showing your skills (e.g., Module 4’s Excel charts).

**Example**: On your Android phone, you might save a Google Slides presentation to Google Drive as a portfolio piece. On your Windows computer, you’d add a link to it in a portfolio document.

**Illustration**: A portfolio is like an art gallery. You display paintings (projects) to wow visitors (employers).

### 3. Presentation and Sharing
**What it is**: Making your resume and portfolio look professional and easy to share, using tools like Google Drive (Module 4).

**Example**: On your Windows computer, you might save your resume as a PDF in Google Drive and share a link. On your Android phone, you’d email the link to a friend for feedback.

**Illustration**: Presentation is like gift-wrapping. A neat package (PDF, clean design) makes the gift (resume) exciting.
