Think of this as a **craft kit**, filled with ready-made templates and software to create marketing plans, support tickets, resumes, and more.

## Why Use Templates and Tools?

Templates and tools are like **blueprints and hammers**, helping you build projects faster and better. Templates provide pre-made formats (e.g., resumes), while tools (e.g., Google Docs) let you customize and create, saving time and boosting professionalism.

They matter because they:
- **Simplify Work**: Templates give a head start on projects like Module 6’s campaign plan.  
- **Ensure Quality**: Professional designs impress clients or employers (Module 6’s resume).  
- **Save Time**: Tools automate tasks, like Module 4’s Excel formulas.  
- **Are Accessible**: Many are free and work on your Windows computer or Android phone.
